# Credit-card-fault-detection

## Problem Statement:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the Apache Spark for the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect most of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
Credit card fraud stands as a major problem for world wide financial institutions. 
Annual losses due to it scales to billions of dollars.

Effective credit risk management has gained an increased focus in recent years, largely due to the fact that inadequate credit risk policies are still the main source of serious problems within the banking industry. 
The chief goal of an effective credit risk management policy must be to maximize a bank's risk-adjusted rate of return by maintaining credit exposure within acceptable limits. 
Moreover, banks need to manage credit risk in the entire portfolio as well as the risk in individual credits or transactions. 
This executive summary seeks to investigate how much progress banks are making in the development and deployment of successful credit risk management strategies.

## Approach Taken:
Three algorithms were used:
- Decision tree
- Randomforest 
- Naive Bayes
